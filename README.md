# TREX
A simple c++ program to play the offline trex game of chrome


The initial approach is follows

* Finding the position of the t-rex and the current status of the t-rex

* finding the cactuses and birds and birds's altitude

* Checking for the distance between obstacle and t-rex every few ms and determining the speed


Just started to work on it.. Will update every few days I hope :-)
